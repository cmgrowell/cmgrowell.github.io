  <p>Preparing for a Race</p>
<p>Summary of a session with Amber Pierce and 2025 Varsity Group</p>
<p>Race Support Network and Preparation
* Build a supportive network to lean on.
* Plan effectively.</p>
<p>Mindset and the Brain
* Mindset shapes how we perceive challenges; our brain filters the world accordingly.
* Learn the difference between reacting (impulsive) and responding (thoughtful).
* The limbic system (fight or flight) activates on race day—use it to marshal resources but avoid overactivation.
* Being nervous is necessary; everyone has a unique optimal performance state.</p>
<p>Working with Your Inner Critic
* The limbic system often acts as the inner critic, detecting stress and fear.
* Name the inner critic (e.g., “Regina”) to externalize and work with it.
* Recognize and interrupt negative thoughts; rewire the brain by replacing or questioning them.
* Shift from fight-or-flight to a social state by acknowledging the critic’s intent and refocusing.</p>
<p>Techniques for Optimal Performance
* Breathwork: Use belly breathing to calm excitement or fear.
* Mantras: Focus on a phrase to stay centered and positive.
* Music: Choose tunes that help you feel energized, calm, or happy.
* Practice awareness of your thoughts daily to improve performance under pressure.</p>
<p>Pre-Race Routine
* Create a consistent pre-race routine to reduce mental load and conserve energy:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Prepare gear the night before.</li>
<li>Use checklists for packing and preparation.</li>
<li>Set alarms for race-day tasks.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A clear routine funnels energy into the race, not logistics.</li>
</ul>
<p>Growth Mindset vs. Fixed Mindset
* Embrace challenges as opportunities to grow and improve skills.
* Reframe failures as learning opportunities.
* Avoid comparing yourself negatively to others; see competitors as allies who push you to excel.
* A growth mindset fosters curiosity and resilience, even when progress isn’t linear.</p>
<p>Pain and Perseverance
* All athletes experience pain; how you interpret it determines its power over you.
* View pain as a test of your capacity and an opportunity to grow.</p>
<p>Competitors and Collaboration
* Competitors are allies in the pursuit of excellence.
* Striving together elevates everyone’s potential.</p>
<p>Sleep and Long-Term Preparation
* Focus on consistent sleep in the two weeks leading to the race rather than just the night before.
* Calming the inner critic supports better rest.</p>
<p>Continuous Improvement
* Always strive to learn what works and adapt.
* The process of improvement is as valuable as the results.</p>
